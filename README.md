# wordpress-shortcodes-xtempl

Usage e.g.
- Create new page called `xtempl_layout1` and compose some layout through the visul aditor
- In another pages (inside the default text editor field) put this to "include that template":

`[xtempl id="xtempl_layout1" title1="Some text" title2="Other text"][/xtempl]`
